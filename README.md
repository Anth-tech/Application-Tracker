Create a database and update your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jobtracker
spring.datasource.username=youruser
spring.datasource.password=yourpass
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

##  Authentication & Security

- JWT-based stateless authentication

- Passwords are stored securely using BCrypt

- All routes are secured by default and require valid tokens

- Users can only CRUD their own application data

---

##  Roadmap

-  Add email verification on signup

-  Implement logout and token revocation (blacklist or refresh tokens)

-  Add DTOs for clean API responses

-  Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

-  Build a frontend in React/Svelte for public use

-  Deploy to Render or Railway
